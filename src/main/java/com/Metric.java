/**
 * Definition: In my humble opinion, a measure and a metric are the same thing. 
 *  And according to the Oxford dictionary, the word measure is derived from the Latin word "metiri".
 *  Having said that however, in speaking with a number of my colleagues, there seems to be a subtle difference. 
 *  The term metric has more of a goal or performance nuance to it, as opposed to measure, a fundamental or unit-specific term.
 Example: Speed limit of 50 km/h, or the boiling temperature of 100 ÂºC, or ordering half a pint of beer.
